Verifying your email address ensures strengthened security, allows IPD staff to better assist you if you forget your password, and gives you access to more features on IPMS.

#### About email verification

You can verify your email address after signing up for a new account. If an email address is undeliverable or bouncing, it will be unverified.

If you do not verify your email address, you will not be able to:

- Receive important updates.
- Recover lost password.
