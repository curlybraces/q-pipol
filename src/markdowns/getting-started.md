## Getting Started with IPMS

Users need individual accounts to use the IPMS.

- [Welcome Screen](#welcome-screen)
- [Creating a new account](#create-account)
- [Login to your account](#login)
- [Verifying your email address](#verify-email) 

### <a name="welcome-screen"></a># Welcome Screen

When you navigate to the application's URL, you will be shown the welcome screen of the IPMS. At the top-right, there are two buttons to help you navigate: `Getting Started` and `Login`. Clicking on `Getting Started` will take you to the system's documentation and tutorial/help. `Login`, on the other hand, will take you to the login page.

### <a name="create-account"></a># Creating a new account

To use the application, a user needs to create an account.

1. Go to the Login page by typing `https://da-ipms2020.web.app/login` or by clicking the `Login` button in the welcome screen.

2. Once in the Login page, click on the `Sign up` at the bottom. The screen below should appear.

3. To sign up, just provide your `full name`(this will help admin identify you), your email (any email will do but it has to be valid), your `password` (must be at least 8 characters), and retype the password to confirm. You can use the `visibility icon` to peek at your password.

4. Finally, click on the `Sign Up` button.

The signup process may take a few seconds but if it doesn't complete, something must be wrong. Otherwise, you should see the following screen:

As with other application, while not required, make sure you verify your [email](#verify-email). Instructions are shown below.

### <a name="verify-email"></a># Verifying your email address

Upon creating a new account, you will receive an email from the system asking you to verify your email. Please check your `SPAM` folder as verification email often enters spam folder. The email should look like the picture below:

Just click on the `Verify Email` button. You should see the following screen:

**Verifying your email address ensures strengthened security, allows IPD staff to better assist you if you forget your password, and gives you access to more features on IPMS.**

### <a name="login"></a># Login to your account

Note that as soon as you create an account, you can already login. Email verification ensures you can recover your account in case you forget/lose your password. To login, go to the login page and enter the email and password you used to create your account. Then, click `Login`.

### <a name="forgot-password"></a># Forgot Password

If you forget your password, just click on the `Forgot Password` and enter the email you used to create your account. This will send a Password Reset link to your email. Remember to check your `SPAM` folder.
