- [Login to your account](#login)
- [Verifying your email address](#verify-email) 

### <a name="welcome-screen"></a>Welcome Screen

When you navigate to the application's URL, you will be shown the welcome screen of the IPMS. At the top-right, there are two buttons to help you navigate: `Getting Started` and `Login`. Clicking on `Getting Started` will take you to the system's documentation and tutorial/help. `Login`, on the other hand, will take you to the login page.

### <a name="create-account"></a>Creating a new account

To use the application, a user needs to create an account.

1. Go to the Login page by typing `https://da-ipms2020.web.app/login` or by clicking the `Login` button in the welcome screen.

2. Once in the Login page, click on the `Sign up` at the bottom. The screen below should appear.

3. To sign up, just provide your `full name`(this will help admin identify you), your email (any email will do but it has to be valid), your `password` (must be at least 8 characters), and retype the password to confirm. You can use the `visibility icon` to peek at your password.

4. Finally, click on the `Sign Up` button.

The signup process may take a few seconds but if it doesn't complete, something must be wrong. Otherwise, you should see the following screen:

As with other application, while not required, make sure you verify your [email](#verify-email). Instructions are shown below.

### <a name="verify-email"></a>Verifying your email address

Upon creating a new account, you will receive an email from the system asking you to verify your email. Please check your `SPAM` folder as verification email often enters spam folder. The email should look like the picture below:

![verify_email](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29625844/83472061-eb7d0c00-a4b8-11ea-893b-9c8f4b1cd097.png)

Just click on the `Verify Email` button. You should see the following screen:

Verifying your email address ensures strengthened security, allows IPD staff to better assist you if you forget your password, and gives you access to more features on IPMS.

#### About email verification

You can verify your email address after signing up for a new account. If an email address is undeliverable or bouncing, it will be unverified.

If you do not verify your email address, you will not be able to:

- Receive important updates.
- Recover lost password.
