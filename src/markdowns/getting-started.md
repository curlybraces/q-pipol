## Getting Started with IPMS

Users need individual accounts to use the IPMS.

- [Creating a new account](#create-account)
- [Verifying your email address](#verify-email)

### <a name="verify-email"></a>Verifying your email address

Verifying your email address ensures strengthened security, allows IPD staff to better assist you if you forget your password, and gives you access to more features on IPMS.

#### About email verification

You can verify your email address after signing up for a new account. If an email address is undeliverable or bouncing, it will be unverified.

If you do not verify your email address, you will not be able to:

- Receive important updates.
- Recover lost password.
