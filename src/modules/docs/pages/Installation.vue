### Requirement/s 

You must have a device running Android or Windows
connected to the internet. Unfortunately, Apple devices currently do not
support progressive web applications. 

### Install PWA on desktop 

It is also possible to install a desktop PWA! Many popular browsers have already
integrated the PWA Install experience to the omnibox. To install a
Progressive Web App to your desktop: 
1. Open a web app in your preferred
browser. 
2. Click on an install button in the address bar. 3. Click
Install. 

### Install PWA on Android device 
1. Open a URL address of a PWA
you want to install in your browser. 
2. Open your browserâ€™s settings. 
3. Scroll down and tap Add to Home screen. 
4. Confirm by tapping Add. 

### Uninstall 
To uninstall from desktop, open the app and tap on the three
vertical dots ( &vellip; ) and select **Uninstall**. To uninstall from
Android device, just long press on the app and uninstall like any other
Android app.
