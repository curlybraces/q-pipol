    "description":"Modernization and the use of modern technology must also cover all crops, including those with export potential in processed or value-added form like coffee, cacao, cassava, tropical fruits, rubber, among others. Relative to that, there is a need to diversify crop production in the Philippines as about 80 percent of the country\u2019s farmlands are devoted to only three crops: rice, corn, and coconut.\n\nAgripreneurship should also form part of the paradigm to modernize Philippine agriculture, as farming and fisheries should be treated as business undertakings or industries. Agripreneurship is also one of the components to industrialize Philippine agriculture.",

At present, the Philippines only has two agricultural products that earn at least $1 billion per year in export receipts: bananas; and coconut products (mostly in oil form). Thailand has 13 types of farm exports earning over $1 billion each year, Indonesia has five, and Vietnam has seven.\n                              \n\nA convergence of efforts of the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Trade and Industry including other departments will be necessary.",
