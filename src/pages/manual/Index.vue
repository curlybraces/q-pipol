      <p>
        The Public Investment Program Online (PIPOL) is an online database
        system that manages data entry and updates on programs, activities and
        projects (PAPs) under the Public Investment Program (PIP), which
        includes the PIPâ€™s Core Investment Programs and Projects (CIPs) and
        Three Year Rolling Infrastructure Program (TRIP), including the
        generation of PIP/CIP/TRIP-related reports. The system is designed to:
        (i) allow online submission by agencies of information regarding their
        priority programs and projects, including project details and status
        updates; (ii) allow the NEDA Secretariat to review and validate agency
        submissions; and (iii) assist the NEDA Secretariat in generating
        reports. Agencies shall be guided by the PIP Guidelines, CIP Guidelines
        issued in June 2016 and the DBM and NEDA Joint Circular No. 2016-01
        issued on 29 January 2016, for the PIP, CIP and TRIP, respectively.
