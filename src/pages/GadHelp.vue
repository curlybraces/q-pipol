      <p>
        Rural development projects—agrarian reform, agriculture, and environment
        and natural resource management—form part of the country’s poverty
        reduction and rural development strategy. They comprise the distribution
        of resources (land titles, stewardship contracts, credit, agricultural
        inputs); introduction of new or improved production or postproduction
        technologies and inputs; improvement of agricultural extension services,
        including the capacity of agricultural extension workers; strengthening
        of agricultural marketing systems; and institutional development, such
        as the formation of agricultural producers’ or marketing groups.
        Projects also usually include the capacity development of relevant
        offices or units of the Philippine implementing agency in project
        development, design, planning, implementation, and monitoring and
        evaluation.

        GENDER ISSUES AND GENDER EQUALITY RESULTS
      </q-item-label>
      <p>
        Gender issues in agriculture and agrarian reform are related to
        inequalities in the status and condition of female and male members of
        agricultural and rural households, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>access to education and health;</li>
        <li>
          access to resources and services to improve their productive and
          reproductive work;
        </li>
        <li>
          norms, attitudes, and institutions that limit women’s and men’s life
          options (including access to land and participation in project
          activities), promote gender-role stereotyping, and result in women’s
          multiple burdens and various forms of violence against women and
          girls;
        </li>
        <li>involvement in organizations and collective action; and</li>
        <li>control over resources and decision-making processes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Agricultural and agrarian reform programs and projects may be designed
        to contribute to the achievement of gender equality results, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          improved capacity of woman and man farmers to improve their
          agricultural production;
        </li>
        <li>enhanced economic options for woman farmers;</li>
        <li>
          increased women’s access to and control over agricultural
          technologies, training credit, markets, and information;
        </li>
        <li>
          increased proportion of women going into rural production activities
          or enterprises that have been traditionally associated with men;
        </li>
        <li>increased number of women adopting new technologies or crops;</li>
        <li>increased employment of rural women and men;</li>
        <li>
          improved leadership capacity of women involved in farmers’
          organizations and similar groups;
        </li>
        <li>
          greater representation of women in producers, marketing, and similar
          rural organizations; and
        </li>
        <li>
          improved capacity of rural development agencies to plan, design,
          implement, and monitor programs and projects that address gender
          issues and the concerns of woman farmers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The identified gender issues need to be addressed by the project through
        specific interventions and activities. To ensure matching of gender
        issues and strategies, one may put forth the following questions: Will
        the interventions or activities reduce gender gaps and inequalities? In
        particular, are project inputs (seed supply, vaccines, or technical
        advice) suited to women’s productive activities? Will the project enable
        women to engage in new or nontraditional agricultural activities?
      </p>
      <q-item-label header>
        GENDER ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
      </q-item-label>
      <p>
        Gender analysis is required at two points of the project
        pre-implementation stage: as part of project identification, and after
        the project has been designed. The guide questions in box 3 (page 8),
        Part I, of this manual may be used for gender analysis at the project
        identification and design stage. Meanwhile, a project design may be
        analyzed using the following guide questions:
      </p>
      <span class="text-weight-bold">Gender roles</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Has the project considered the actual roles and responsibilities of
          women and men in agriculture?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is the project addressing the array of women’s agricultural
          activities, including subsistence and cash-crop activities?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will new technologies be introduced to assist women in agriculture?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will this make other agricultural activities accessible to women?
        </li>
        <li>
          Does the project consider roles and responsibilities of women and men
          in farm and off-farm activities?
        </li>
        <li>
          Has the project considered how women and men fit their agricultural
          activities with their other productive, reproductive, and community
          tasks?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will the project increase the time spent by women or men on
          agriculture-related activities?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will participation of women and the men in the project affect their
          other responsibilities? Or, will the project or new technology affect
          women’s (men’s) work schedules or overall workloads?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="text-weight-bold"
        >Access to and control of agricultural resources</span
      >
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do women have the same access to or control as men over sufficient
          land areas to participate in the project?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will women and men have equal access to credit, extension services and
          information, and technology provided by the project?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will the project involve female extension officers? Woman farmer
          leaders?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will the training and technology help women in their current
          activities?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are agency/project trainers, extension officers and other personnel
          aware of gender issues in agriculture or in agricultural projects?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can training of agency/project personnel ensure the
          gender-responsiveness of the project?
        </li>
        <li>
          Will women face more competition in their traditional crop or
          agricultural markets?

        <li>
          Do the constraints to women’s participation require separate

      <q-item-label header>GUIDE FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE CHECKLIST</q-item-label>
      <p>
        Box 8 lists the ten requirements for a gender-responsive agriculture
        project. Each requirement or element is generally accompanied by a set
        of guide questions. The scoring system is the same as that boxes 5 and
        6, while the interpretation of the total score is the same as that in
        box 7. The guide for accomplishing the checklist and the interpretation
        of the total GAD rating are reproduced below for easy reference.
      </p>

        <p class="text-center text-weight-bold">
          Guide for accomplishing box 8
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Put a check <q-icon name="check_box"></q-icon> in the appropriate
          column (2a to 2c) under “Response” to signify the degree to which a
          project proponent has complied with the GAD element: under col. 2a if
          nothing has been done; under col. 2b if an element, item, or question
          has been partly answered; and under col. 2c if an element, item, or
          question has been fully complied with.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. A partial and a full yes may be distinguished as follows.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
          <li>
            a. For Element 1.0, a “partly yes” to Question 1.1 (or Q1.1) means
            meeting with male officials and only one or a few women who also
            happen to be officials of the proponent or partner agency or
            organization; or with male and female officials and some male
            beneficiaries. In contrast, full compliance involves meeting with
            female and male officials and consulting other stakeholders,
            including women and men that may be affected positively or
            negatively by the proposed project. A “partly yes” to Q1.2 means
            inputs or suggestions may have been sought from woman and man
            beneficiaries but are not considered at all in designing project
            activities and facilities. A “partly yes” to Q1.3 means only certain
            groups of women and men are viewed as stakeholders and agents of
            change.
          </li>
          <li>
            b. For Element 2.0, “partly yes” means some information has been
            classified by sex but may not be key to helping identify major
            gender issues that a planned project must address. In contrast, a
            full “yes” implies that qualitative and quantitative data are cited
            in the analysis of the development issue or project.
          </li>
          <li>
            c. For Element 3.0, “partly yes” means superficial or partial
            analysis has been done by focusing on only one or two of the
            concerns (gender roles, needs, perspectives, or access to and
            control of resources).
          </li>
          <li>
            d. For Element 4.0, “partly yes” means women are mentioned in the
            project objectives but only in connection with traditional roles
            (Q4.1); or the project has token gender equality outputs or outcomes
            (Q4.2). A full “yes” to Q4.1 signifies that women’s nontraditional
            roles are also recognized, while a full “yes” to Q4.2 denotes that
            gender equality outcomes and outputs are consistently pursued in the
            logframe.
          </li>
          <li>
            e. For Element 5.0, “partly yes” means having gender equality
            strategies or activities but no stated gender issues to match the
            activities (Q5.1). A full “yes” means there is an identified gender
            issue and there are activities seeking to address these issues. In
            the case of Q5.2, “partly yes” means the project builds on women and
            men’s knowledge and skills as a token, or not in a serious way.
          </li>
          <li>
            f. For Element 6.0, a “partly yes” response to any of the items and
            questions is associated with superficial or partial effort to
            address a specific issue or question. In contrast, a full “yes”
            involves a coherent, if not a comprehensive, response to the
            question.
          </li>
          <li>
            g. For Element 7.0, “partly yes” means the project monitoring plan
            includes indicators that are sex-disaggregated but no qualitative
            indicator of empowerment or status change.
          </li>
          <li>
            h. For Element 8.0, “partly yes” means the project requires the
            collection of some sexdisaggregated data or information but not all
            the information will track the genderdifferentiated effects of the
            project. A full “yes” means all sex-disaggregated data and
            qualitative information will be collected to help monitor GAD
            outcomes and outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            i. For Element 9.0, “partly yes” means there is a budget for
            GAD-related activities but this is insufficient to ensure that the
            project will address relevant gender issues (Q9.1), or build GAD
            capacities among project staff or the project agency or tap external
            GAD expertise (Q9.2).
          </li>
          <li>
            j. For Element 10.0, a “partly yes” response to Q10.1 means there is
            a mention of the agency’s GAD plan but no direct connection is made
            to incorporate the project’s GAD efforts into the plan; to Q10.2
            means there is a mention of other GAD initiatives in the project
            coverage but no indication of how the project will build on these
            initiatives; to Q10.3 means the project has a sustainability plan
            for its GAD efforts but makes no mention of how these will be
            institutionalized within the implementing agency or its partners.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          3. After ascertaining whether a GAD requirement has been fulfilled or
          not, enter the appropriate score for an element or item under column
          3.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>
            a. To ascertain the score for a GAD element, a three-point rating
            scale is provided: “0” when the proponent has not accomplished any
            of the activities or questions listed under an element or
            requirement; a score that is less than the stated maximum when
            compliance is only partial; and “2” (for the element or
            requirement), or the maximum score for an item or question, when the
            proponent has done all the required activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            b. The scores for “partly yes” differ by element. For instance, the
            score for “partly yes” for Elements 2.0, 3.0, 7.0, and 8.0 is “1.”
            For elements that have two or more items or questions (such as
            Element 1.0), the rating for a “partial yes” is the sum of the
            scores of the items or questions that falls short of the maximum
            “2.”
          </li>
          <li>
            c. For Element 9.0, which has two items (9.1 and 9.2), the maximum
            score for each item is pegged at “1.0” and for “partly yes” is
            “0.5.” Hence, if a project scores a full “1.0” in one question but
            “0” in the other, or if a project scores “partly yes” (or “0.5”) in
            each of the two items, the total rating for Element 9.0 will be
            “partly yes” with a score of “1.0.” If a project scores “partly yes”
            in one item but “no” in the other, then the total rating for the
            element will be “0.5.”
          </li>
          <li>
            d. For Elements 6.0 and 10.0, which have three items each, the
            maximum score for each item is pegged at “0.67” and for “partly yes”
            is “0.33.” The rating for the element will be “partly yes” if the
            total score of the three items is positive but less than “2.0,” the
            maximum for the element.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          4. For an element (col. 1) that has more than one item or question,
          add the score for the items and enter the sum in the thickly bordered
          cell for the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Add the scores in the thickly bordered cells under column 3 to come
          up with the GAD score for the project identification and design
          stages.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Under the last column, indicate the key gender issues identified
          (for proponents) or comments on the proponent’s compliance with the
          requirement (for evaluators).
        </p>
